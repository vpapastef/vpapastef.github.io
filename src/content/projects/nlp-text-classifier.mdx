## Overview

A text classification system built on top of pretrained transformer models, fine-tuned for multi-label classification tasks. Includes a Streamlit demo for interactive testing.

## Approach

1. **Data preparation**: Custom dataset class with stratified splitting for multi-label data
2. **Model selection**: Compared BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for the task
3. **Training**: Fine-tuned with learning rate scheduling and early stopping
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including per-label precision, recall, and F1

## Results

The fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved a macro F1 of 0.87 on the test set, outperforming the BERT baseline by 3 points while being 40% faster at inference with DistilBERT distillation.

## Demo

The Streamlit app lets you input text and see real-time predictions with confidence scores for each label.
