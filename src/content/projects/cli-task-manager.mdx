## Overview

A terminal-based task manager for developers who live in the command line. Fast startup, beautiful output with Rich, and SQLite for persistence.

## Usage

```bash
task add "Write blog post about probability"
task list
task done 1
task tag 2 ml urgent
task list --tag ml
```

## Design Philosophy

- **Fast**: SQLite means no server, no network calls. Startup in milliseconds.
- **Minimal**: Do one thing well. No Gantt charts, no team features, no cloud sync.
- **Beautiful**: Rich library for colored output, tables, and progress bars.
- **Scriptable**: JSON output mode for piping into other tools.

## What I Learned

This project was an exercise in restraint. The temptation to add features is strong, but the best CLI tools are the ones that do one thing exceptionally well.
