## Overview

An interactive dashboard for exploring multidimensional datasets. Built with Plotly Dash, it provides dynamic filtering, multiple chart types, and the ability to export visualizations.

## Features

- **Dynamic filtering**: Filter data across multiple dimensions with linked charts
- **Multiple chart types**: Scatter, bar, histogram, heatmap, and more
- **Export**: Download filtered data as CSV or charts as PNG
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and tablet

## Technical Details

The dashboard uses a callback-driven architecture where user interactions trigger data transformations and chart updates. Data is loaded and preprocessed with pandas, then visualized with Plotly's interactive charting library.
