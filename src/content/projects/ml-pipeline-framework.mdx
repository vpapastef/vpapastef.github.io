## Overview

A modular framework for building production-ready ML pipelines. Designed to make the journey from experimentation to deployment as smooth as possible.

## Key Features

- **Reproducible experiments**: Every run is tracked with MLflow, including hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts
- **Modular architecture**: Swap data loaders, models, and evaluation metrics without changing pipeline code
- **Easy deployment**: Export models as Docker containers with a FastAPI serving layer
- **Configuration-driven**: Define experiments in YAML, no code changes needed for hyperparameter sweeps

## Architecture

The framework follows a clean separation of concerns:

```
data_loader → preprocessor → model → evaluator → deployer
```

Each component implements a simple interface, making it easy to extend with custom implementations.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project taught me that the hardest part of ML isn't the models — it's everything around them. Data versioning, experiment tracking, and deployment are where most of the complexity lives.
